# FizzBuzzGame

From The Eloquent Javascript Book

# INSTRUCTION

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the
number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

# SOLUTION

I used the FOR loop for this exercise for numbers that count up to 100, and then I changed the code from the instruction such that the User is prompted to insert a number and the loop will count up to the inserted value and still print "Fizz" for number divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divible by 5 and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisble by both 3 and 5.
